- **Sample Size Variation**: Some categories have limited data for robust analysis

## Recommendations

### For Model Improvement
1. **Bias Correction**: Implement calibration to reduce positive prediction bias
2. **Volatility Modeling**: Enhance longer-term return prediction accuracy
3. **Category Balancing**: Collect more data for underrepresented filing categories
4. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate more market context variables

### For Trading Strategy
1. **Optimize by Time Horizon**: Use 5-day for accuracy (57.9%), 9-day for larger returns (0.84%)
2. **Category Selection**: Prioritize 7.01 (5-day) and 8.01 (both horizons) filing types
3. **Confidence Thresholds**: Use 60%+ confidence for 5-day, 65%+ for 9-day predictions
4. **Risk Management**: Account for 2% (5-day) or 2.5% (9-day) prediction error in position sizing
5. **Horizon Switching**: Use 5-day for high-frequency trading, 9-day for swing trading

## Conclusion

The SEC 8-K prediction model demonstrates promising performance with 57.9% accuracy and well-calibrated return predictions. The model shows particular strength in predicting regulatory disclosures and other events, while struggling with earnings-related filings. The consistent performance across different stocks and time periods suggests the approach is robust and scalable.

Key success factors include the integration of sentiment analysis, financial impact assessment, and market context. The model's ability to maintain accuracy across a 10-year period for MSFT demonstrates its potential for long-term deployment.

Future improvements should focus on reducing positive bias and enhancing longer-term volatility predictions while maintaining the strong directional accuracy already achieved.
